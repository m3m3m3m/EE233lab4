in this lab, we will first build three filters for frequencies of 250$ \si{\hertz} $, 1$ \si{\kilo\hertz} $ and 4$ \si{\kilo\hertz} $. The gain plots, the waveform, and some AC parameters such as center frequencies, cutoff frequencies will be enclosed. In the second part, we will build the whole audio mixer including two summing amplifier, one buffer, one preamplifier and an equalizer with three filters. We will also discuss the function of each part in the audio mixer by changing potentiometers and plotting Bode plots. We will also simulate the entire mixer in SPICE and enclose the simulation plot.
