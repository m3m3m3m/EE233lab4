In the first part of the lab, we can conclude that out choice for capacitors are proper after we recorded the data, plotted the gain, simulated in SPICE and plotted the Bode plots. In the second part, we successfully build the audio mixer and figured out the function of each part of an audio mixer. %TODO add more specific functions
