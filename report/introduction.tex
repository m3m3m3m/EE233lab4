In this lab, we learned how to design filters from a given topology and specifications, analyze
the characteristics of the designed filters, measure the characteristics of the designed filter, and complete the entire audio mixing console. Here the filters will be part of an equalizer system, which can adjust the frequency response and the amplitude of certain frequencies.
